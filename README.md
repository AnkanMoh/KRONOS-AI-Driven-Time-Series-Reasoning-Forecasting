# KRONOS: AI-Driven Time Series Reasoning & Forecasting

This repository contains my end-to-end implementation of **KRONOS**, a hybrid reasoning + fine-tuning system built for competition-style time-series forecasting and structured output generation.

The project includes:
- Complete fine-tuning pipeline  
- Preprocessing + evaluation notebook  
- Submission bundle and trained weights  
- Dataset files  
- Reference implementation for inference  

This repo is being built step-by-step and will progressively include:
- 📁 `src/` — training, inference, utils  
- 📁 `models/` — exported trained models  
- 📁 `data/` — evaluation and sample datasets  
- 📁 `results/` — metrics & logs  

More updates coming soon.
